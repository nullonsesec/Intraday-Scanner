# 🧠 Scanner Logic

Stocks are filtered based on:

| Condition       | Value             |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| Price Range     | ₹220 – ₹650       |
| Weekly Movement | > ₹20             |
| RSI             | > 55              |
| Volume Breakout | Optional AI boost |

---

# 📊 AI Ranking System

The AI score is calculated using:

```python
AI Score =
(Movement × 0.5)
+ (RSI × 0.3)
+ Volume Breakout Bonus
```

This helps prioritize:

* Strong momentum
* Healthy RSI
* Unusual volume activity
